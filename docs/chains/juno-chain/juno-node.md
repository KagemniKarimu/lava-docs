# Running a Juno RPC Node

## Install Junod 🚀

Follow the instructions provided in the Juno Network documentation (https://docs.junonetwork.io/validators/getting-setup) to install the Junod software. This software is necessary to run a Juno RPC node.

## Decide Juno Mainnet 🌐  or Testnet 🧪

Choose whether you want to participate in the Juno Mainnet or the Testnet. The Mainnet is the live network where real transactions occur and you will incur real costs, while the Testnet is a separate network for testing and experimentation where you can operate free from concern about incurring costs.

- If you’ve decided to join the Juno Mainnet, refer to the documentation here: https://docs.junonetwork.io/validators/joining-mainnet
- If you’ve decided to join the Juno Testnet, refer to the documentation here: https://docs.junonetwork.io/validators/joining-the-testnets

Once you’ve done that, all that’s left to do is register on Lava Network!

## Apply to our Provider Incubation Program 📋

In our current state of Testnet, there is an additional stage to pass through before you can become a provider on the Lava Network. Please fill out the [application form](https://lavanet.typeform.com/to/ORi3A13v?utm_source=becoming-a-lava-provider-for-juno&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=juno-pre-grant) for our Provider Incubation Program. Feel free to drop a line in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UxujNZbW) once you’ve completed this step!

## Setup your Provider on Lava Network 🌋

Once you’ve been accepted - to set up your provider on the Lava Network, you can refer to the [provider setup documentation](https://docs.lavanet.xyz/provider-setup?utm_source=running-a-juno-rpc-node&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=juno-pre-grant) available elsewhere in our docs. This should provide you with the necessary information to configure and operate your provider node.
